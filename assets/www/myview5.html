 The word "corruption" has been in existing ever since our human race came into existence. From the times of the Indus Valley Civilization to Modern India, it is a global phenomenon and has progressively increased in our competitive society. Most of us consider it as the wrongdoings on the part of an authority or powerful party through the means that are illegitimate, immoral or incompatible with ethical standards. You might say that this results in patronage and is associated with bribery. This is Political corruption. Have you every asked yourself what leads to Political corruption? In 2011, India witnessed a huge civil moments. The word politician seems to have become an insult to such an extent that even the progressive youth fear to be a part of the system for change. First came a Baba, who tried to fulfill his political ambitions. Then a Gandhian mascot eventually failed when he tried to become a messiah. With all due respect to the old man, his team seemed more corrupt than the people they were accusing. Their motive was not pure.
 
I want to ask you simple questions-What is corruption? Is it just about giving or accepting bribes? Does it only exist in the political and bureaucratic system? What are we doing about it (except for talking)?</br>
Should we simply pass the buck and blame our politicians and say that it is a part of the system? Should we blindly follow a civil movement that ridicules the largest democracy in the world? Or should we look at ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves a few uneasy questions? Questions that will mentally disturb most of us. Questions that will lead to a lot of people criticizing this article of mine. Before coming that, let me define corruption.</br>
Corruption is the act of debasing or the state of being debased. More than dishonest proceedings, it is about moral perversion or perversion of integrity. It is any debasing influence. It is the act of alteration, as of language, a text, or a word. It is spiritual or moral impurity. It is the impairment of integrity, virtue or moral principles. It is the departure from the original or from what is pure or correct. It is the action of making someone or something depraved. It is the change from good to bad in morals, manners or actions.</br>
Now sincerely look into the mirror and ask yourself- does corruption not begin at home? ARE WE NOT CORRUPT? Your conscience will give an answer.</br>
Abdul Kalam very rightly said, "If a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel that there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother and the teacher".</br>
Let us hope that 2012 will be a year of change, where we will be the change ourselves. Let us all take a resolution this New Year that we will not blame others, not only in the case of corruption but also in any which is relevant to the well being of our country. Let us hope that the new age politician is less of an actor and has a pure motive, let us give him the opportunity to look beyond the next election and make hard choices.. Let us be the change in the system, rather than blaming the system. Let us hope that we do not follow for the sake of following. Let us create an alternative. Let us have the audacity to hope- for hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark and we must let our hopes, not our hurts, shape our future.</br>
When a population of one billion unites, the word impossible shivers in fear and splits into "I'm possible". The "I am Anna" captioned paper Nehru cap seems to have become a cool new trend. Lets hope that this is replaced by "I AM UNSTOPPABLE INDIA".
