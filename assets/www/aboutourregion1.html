Founded in the early 16th century, the Karamsot dynasty has a long lineage of capable rulers who fought hard battles but "lived with grace and dignity". Rao Karamsiji was the eighth son of Rao Jodhaji who was the founder of Jodhpur. He established his kingdom between his brothers- the Maharajas of Jodhpur and Bikaner. The construction of the fort commenced in 1523 A.D. in the fairytale land of majestic forts and palaces. Thus began the dynasty of the Karamsot Rathores. Within the fort walls, one can visit ancient temple of Lord Shiva and it also houses sandstone carvings of the 9th Century Jain Gods & Goddesses, defaced by Aurangzeb, a ruler of the Mughal dynasty. Pillars erected in memory of war heroes & of 'Sati' (when courageous Rajput women burnt themselves alive on the funeral pyre of their husbands). The periphery of the Fort has an ancient ruin known as Fateh Mahal or Ruims- named after Fateh Pir Baba, a great Sufi Saint who blessed the family. After his death, he was buried adjoining the fort walls. Fateh Mahal was under construction as a personal residence next to his tomb. The ruling chief died during the construction phase. Superstition had it that the Saint's spirit was not in peace. Hence, the building was left incomplete. Today these ruins provide an exquisite experience- a glimpse of the bygone era. The royal garage is home to a row of vintage cars-gleaming and immaculate!</br>

The present district of Nagaur finds a place in the heart of the Rajasthan state. If we draw a cross over the map of Rajasthan the centre of this cross is bound to fall in the district of Nagaur. Before the merger of the states, Nagaur was a part of the erstwhile Jodhpur State. .

After independence, Nagaur had the honour of being selected as the place in the country from where the Democratic Decentralization process was launched by the late Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India on the 2nd October 1959.

A big part of the district is covered by blown sand and sand dunes which form part of the great Thar district. Active dunes and sand shifting are main hazards to cultivation. Sand dunes are common in the north and western parts, where they arise over 30 meters and are aligned in a north west and south cast direction. Constant deterioration of soil and mining activity has resulted in soil erosion.</br>

The Aravali range of hills passes in eastern and south eastern part of the district. The average elevation of the hills in district is barely 310 meters.</br>

There in no perennial river in the district, River Luni is a non-perennial river which flows through the district. The flow of river-Luni depends upon the volume of rain fall it receives during monsoons. The river rises near Pushkar in Ajmer district and after passing over the Western slopes of the Aravali enters Nagaur district in the south and flows through it towards the west for nearly 37 Kilometers before entering Pali district.</br>

A big salt lake exists about 3 Km., to the South West of Deedwana. A part of the famous Sambhar lake falls in Nagaur district.
