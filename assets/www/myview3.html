All successful mega sports events have had one thing in common- the enthusiasm and backing of it's citizens, who had a sense of pride and faith in the legacy created by these wonderful sporting spectacles.</br>
Emerson rightly said- "enthusiasm is the mother of efforts, and without it nothing great was ever achieved".
Let's take the case of Delhi 2010. The politicians are playing the blame game. China has a reason to laugh. The media seems to have found yet another masala story which would increase their T.R.P's. And most importantly, we the people were least bothered till the last moment. Everyone is cribbing about the embarrassment that is being caused. Where were these voices a year ago? Did we, the mango people take any interest or did we voice our concerns at the right time? Did the success of these games really bother us? Were we even interested in the Commonwealth Games?</br>
We are yet again enhancing our reputation of taking shortcuts and doing things at the last minute. Today we should have been talking about our athletes and medals, rather than this mess. It's sad! It's a shame because India has the potential and brilliant minds to host such events.</br>
At the end of the day, it's not about an organizational committee or the politicians in charge, it's about the reputation and image of us INDIANS. Let's stop pointing fingers at one another. It's time to wake up and learn from this experience. Our country has a bright future. All we need is a change in the system, and the first step to it would be a change in our mindset. "India needs anger- channeled in the right direction. The world often continues to allow evil because it isn't angry enough.</br>
Team England's chef de mission was quoted as saying that this event is like an Indian wedding and it will be ready just before the bride arrives. It's time to remind him that monsoon weddings in our country are electric and a whole lot of fun. It's time to remind him that whatever the situation might be, our guests never leave disappointed.</br>
With just 240 hours to the opening ceremony of Delhi 2010, let's pray that these games are a success. Let's take a vow that we will never let such situations arise again. Let's have faith...COME OUT AND PLAY!
