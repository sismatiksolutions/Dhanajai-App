Swamiji was one of the greatest spiritual leaders of the modern world, a great lover of humanity whose unconditional love extended to all people without any distinctions of caste, class, creed, race, region or religion.</br>

Swami Vivekananda believed a country's future depends on its people; his teachings focussed on man making.</br>

Swami Vivekananda was the principal reason behind the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West. He defined his mission as 'Man Making' - shaping the personality of fellow humans.</br>

One of my favorite quotes of Swami ji was on a subject close to me -
"To me the very essence of education is concentration of mind, not the collecting of facts"</br>

According to Swami Ji, It is in the transformation of man through moral and spiritual education that he finds the solution for all social evils.
Born Narendra Nath Datta, Swami Ji was an Indian Hindu monk and chief disciple of the 19th-century saint Ramakrishna. He acted as a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech which began,"Sisters and brothers of America..,"in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.</br>

During travels Swamiji was pained to see the pitiable condition of his countrymen. He wanted a solution which would be in conformity with the religious and cultural traditions of india. Swamiji decided to go to west to broadcast India’s spiritual message and seek help from them to improve the conditions in India. Swamiji said that service to humanity was equivalent to worship of God.

There are two inspirational thoughts on Swami Ji by other respected people. It is perhaps the biggest recognition that Swami Ji could have received for his contribution.:

"It is undisputed fact that it was Swami Vivekananda who first held aloft the banner of Hinduism as a challenge against the material science of the West.it was Swami Vivekananda, who took on his shoulders this stupendous task of establishing the glory of Hinduism in different countries across the borders. And he, with his erudition oratorical power, enthusiasm and inner force, laid that work upon a solid foundation. - <b>Bal Gangadhar Tilak.</b></br>

"How shall I express in words my indebtedness to Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda? It is under their sacred influence that my life got first awaked. Like Nivedita I also regard Ramakrishna and Vivekananda as two aspects of one indivisible personality. If Swamiji had been alive today, he would have been my Guru, that is to say, I would have accepted him as my Master. It is needless to add, however, that as long as I live I shall be absolutely loyal and devoted to Ramakrishna - Vivekananda." -<b> Subshash Chandra Bose</b>.</br>

I hope that each day, each element from Swami Ji's life will shape my thoughts to serve the country.</br>
