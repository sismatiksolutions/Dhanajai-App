<b style="padding:10px;">If Cricket is Religion, Sachin is God.</b></br>
<p style="height:100%;padding:10px;">
For a person that is defined by such quotes, as a batsman and a person, Sachin is indeed an inspiring personality. I have been fortunate to see him since birth to his latest match in England.After 24 years in International Cricket, shouldering the expectations of 1 billion people, each one of us has to learn the skill of being calm and composed as well as being down to earth from Tendulkar

In his long career, he has never uttered a word against his critics and has always let his bat do the talking. Though his generation too saw some other great performers in Ricky Ponting, Brain Lara, Steve Waugh, Rahul Dravid, he has been a standout sportsperson for various reasons.</br>

When Sachin Started his career at the young age of 16, he had a maturity beyond his age. He demonstrated his supreme skills in facing Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. His test hundred on the fastest track in the world in Perth Australia is a life's lesson in perseverance and concentration.

Another important point worth mentioning is that he was he was very comfortable in playing both on front foot and back foot, which was a rare sight in Indian team at that time. It showcased how diverse and rare a talent Sachin was in the Indian sporting circuit.</br>
I have heard a lot of people criticising Sachin, saying whenever he scores India loses.</br>

While Sachin did begin his career with a comparitively weaker team, with time he became an integral part of a strong unit with Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, VVS Laxman and Javagal Srinath. His transformation of being the attacker in early part of his career to being the back bone of the team is indicative of his adjusting beautifully to the needs of the team.

Many instances come to mind when one considers Sachin's single minded dedication to the team - be it the innings in Sharjah or the one against Pakistan in Chennai or the one against Australia. While the team failed him often, he never let down his supporters.</br>

As a trans-generational player, Sachin played with three generations of Indian cricketers. It was perhaps his preparation for a match that made him a success. He has stated a number of times that for him, a Ranji trophy match was as important as a World Cup Match.</br>

There was a level of pre- preparedness in his activities and shots which made him help read the bowlers mind. His preparation to face Shane Warne in 1998 on dusty Indian wickets was legendary. There was an occasion when Brad Hodge dismissed Sachin round his legs. After the match, he autographed the ball and wrote "This will never happen again." Such was his confidence, he has never been dismissed again that way.

Dhoni, was 8 years old when Sachin made is debut and is said to have been the biggest inspiration for Sachin.</br>

Here was an example for what could a person do and achieve with passion and hard work.

When one plays for 24 years, records are bound to come along. However, playing with the same motivation and love for the game, requires a element of patriotism and love for the nation as well.

My biggest learning from his life will be to understand and imbibe that no matter what one does, one can easily act as a great uniter for the nation and can fill the heart of each Indian with pride and glory.</br>
