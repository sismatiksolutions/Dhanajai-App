<b style="padding:10px;">A Politician Thinks of The Next Election,A Statesman Thinks of the Next Generation</b></br>
<p style="height:100%;padding:10px;">
Born on 25th December 1924, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has contributed a lot to India's Progress. Having been active in Indian politics for over 50 years, he has given our political structure a new face by being a founder member of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh and then the Bharatiya Janata Party.</br>

Apart from being a political hero for millions of Indians over many generations, he is also an excellent writer and poet.</br>

 In 1957, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji was first elected to the Lok Sabha, the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru was so impressed by the oratorical skills of Atal Ji that the former commented to his fellow parliamentarians that this young MP would lead the nation one day.</br>

As External Affairs Minister in the Morarji Desai Govt. Shri Vajpayee charmed the world with his powerful speech at the United Nations. As a youngster, the video of that speech has been a huge motivator.</br>

Having worked tirelessly for years, Shri. Vajpayee Led the BJP and the NDA to power over 3 terms of 13 days, 13 months and a complete 5 year term. His speech before the fall of the 13 month govt. is said to be one of the most moving speeches in Parliament particularly for his calling on the Congress to think of the country than to be Greedy for Power. He emphasized how he was against horse trading (poaching opposition MPs by offering something) just to win a majority for his government and that he would come back as prime minister if he deserved to lead the country</br>

The concept of Good Governance in India was introduced by Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji between 1999-2004. He groomed leaders like Vasundhara Raje ji, Narendra Modi Ji, Pramod Mahajan Ji, Shivraj Singh Chauhan ji who are today leading the nation to continue his good work.</br>

Being the global statesman that he was, he tried to build bridges with Pakistan through a historic Bus Yatra. He will always be remembered by the nation of taking the historic step of a nuclear test undetected from the Global Powerhouse nations. The Historic photograph of Shri. Vajpayee, Shri. George Fernandes and Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam from Pokhran will continue to Inspire generations.</br>

I consider the India - Pakistan Kargil War a high point of Vajpayee Ji's tenure as PM as India once again gave a befitting reply to Pakistan in Operation "Vijay". He handled tough situations like the attack on the Indian Parliament and the Hijack of IC814 in the best possible way raising India's goodwill and respect across the world.</br>

As a leader, Atal Ji was one of the best orators of his generation and attracted huge crowds to his rallies. He had acceptance across castes, communities and religions. His work in connecting and upgrading the National Highways of our country as well as in strengthening the Indian Economy has helped India grow faster in the 21st century.</br>

His announcement of retiring from active politics in 2005 was on the back of his faith in the next generation of BJP leadership to take the country forward.
My attachment to Shri. Vajpayee is also through his poetry which has helped me shape my thoughts to serve the nation and guides me forward. His work "Unchai" will forever be my favorite composition along with "Kadam Mila kar chalna hoga".</br>

I eagerly await Shri. Vajpayee's nomination for the Bharat Ratna for perhaps this is one personality that has shown the brightest in Independent India.</br>
